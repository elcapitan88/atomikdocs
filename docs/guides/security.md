# Security Best Practices

This guide outlines the security best practices for using AtomikTrading safely and protecting your account and trading operations.

## Account Security

### Strong Password Practices

- Use a unique, complex password of at least 12 characters
- Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Never reuse passwords from other services
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords
- Change your password periodically (every 90 days is recommended)

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

AtomikTrading supports multiple 2FA methods for enhanced security:

1. **Enable 2FA**: Go to Account Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication
2. **Choose Your Method**:
   - Authenticator App (recommended): Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator
   - SMS verification (less secure but better than no 2FA)
   - Hardware security keys (most secure option, like YubiKey)
3. **Backup Recovery Codes**: Store these codes securely in case you lose access to your 2FA device
