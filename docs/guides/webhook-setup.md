Webhook Setup
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up webhooks with AtomikTrading to automate your trading strategies.
What are Webhooks?
Webhooks allow external systems to notify AtomikTrading of events that should trigger trading actions. They function as automated callbacks, where a URL is configured to receive data when specific events occur.
Creating a Webhook

Log in to your AtomikTrading account and navigate to Webhooks in the dashboard.
Click Create New Webhook.
Configure your webhook settings:

Name: A descriptive name for your webhook
Description: Optional details about the webhook's purpose
URL Path: The unique URL path for your webhook
Secret Key: Used to verify the webhook source
Actions: Define what actions should be taken when the webhook is triggered


Click Save to create your webhook.
